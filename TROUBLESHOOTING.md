# GitHub Pages Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç Quick Diagnostics

### Step 1: Check Your Repository Settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** (top menu)
3. Click **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Look for a green box that says: "Your site is published at https://..."
   - ‚úÖ If you see this ‚Üí Your site is live!
   - ‚ùå If not ‚Üí Continue to Step 2

### Step 2: Verify GitHub Pages is Enabled

In Settings ‚Üí Pages, check:

**Source:**
- Branch: Should be `main` (or `master`)
- Folder: Should be `/ (root)`
- Click **Save** if you made any changes

**Repository Visibility:**
- Your repository must be **Public** (not Private)
- Go to Settings ‚Üí scroll to bottom ‚Üí Check "Danger Zone"
- If it says "Change repository visibility" and shows Private ‚Üí Make it Public

### Step 3: Verify Your Files

Make sure these files are in the **root** of your repository:
- ‚úÖ `index.html`
- ‚úÖ `styles.css`
- ‚úÖ `script.js`

**To check on GitHub:**
1. Go to your repository main page
2. You should see these files listed directly (not inside a folder)
3. If they're inside a folder, you need to move them to root

### Step 4: Wait Time

GitHub Pages can take:
- **First deployment**: 5-10 minutes
- **Updates**: 1-3 minutes

If you just enabled it, wait 10 minutes and refresh.
